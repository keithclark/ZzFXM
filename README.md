# ZzFX Music Generator

This is a music generator for use in tiny JavaScript productions (i.e. js13k games). ZzFXM uses a modified version of the super-tiny [ZzFX library](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/ZzFX) by [Frank Force](https://twitter.com/KilledByAPixel) to generate instruments. The modified version of ZzFX is able create an array of audio data without immediately playing it.

The song format is loosely based on the MOD format, using patterns to handle repeating blocks of song data. Unlike MOD, patterns can be variable in length allowing repeatitive sequences of pattern data to be broken down into smaller chunks. Each pattern can also contain a variable number of channels, reducing the need to store empty data.


## Use

```html
<!-- load dependencies -->
<script src="zzfx.js"></script>
<script src="zzfxm.min.js"></script>

<script>
  // Create a song
  let mySongData = zzfxM(...song);

  // Play the song (returns a AudioBufferSourceNode)
  let myAudioNode = zzfxP(mySongData);

  // Stop the song
  myAudioNode.stop();
</script>
```


## Song Format

A ZzFXM song is a series of nested arrays containing instrument, pattern and sequence data:

```js
[                                     // Song
  [                                     // Instruments
    [.9, 0, 143, , , .35, 3],             // Instrument 1
    [1, 0, 216, , , .45, 1, 4, , ,50]     // Instrument 2
  ],
  [                                     // Patterns

## Pattern List Structure

```
[
  <pattern>,
  ...
]
```

## Pattern Structure

```
[
  <channel>,
  ...
]
```

## Channel Structure

```
[
  <channel-instrument>, <channel-period>, <channel-attenuation>,
  ...
]
```

Channel data is a single array containing 3 slots for each row in the current pattern.
The first slot indicates which instrument to use for playing notes. Slot 2 contains the note period and slot 3 holds the attenuation value. A `0` value indicates a noop for that slot.

## Channel Period

If this slot contains a value between 1 and 36 then the corresponding note will be played with the current instrument. When a new period is set any note currently playing in the channel is stopped and the channel attenuation is reset.

Value | Note | Value | Note | Value | Note
------|------|-------|------|-------|-----
`01`  | C-1  | `0d`  | C-2  | `19`  | C-3
`02`  | C#1  | `0e`  | C#2  | `1a`  | C#3
`03`  | D-1  | `0f`  | D-2  | `1b`  | D-3
`04`  | D#1  | `10`  | D#2  | `1c`  | D#3
`05`  | E-1  | `11`  | E-2  | `1d`  | E-3
`06`  | F-1  | `12`  | F-2  | `1e`  | F-3
`07`  | F#1  | `13`  | F#2  | `1f`  | F#3
`08`  | G-1  | `14`  | G-2  | `20`  | G-3
`09`  | G#1  | `15`  | G#2  | `21`  | G#3
`0a`  | A-1  | `16`  | A-2  | `22`  | A-3
`0b`  | A#1  | `17`  | A#2  | `23`  | A#3
`0c`  | B-1  | `18`  | B-2  | `24`  | B-3


## Channel Instrument

This contains an index pointing to the songs instrument array. If it contains a non-zero value then instrument `value-1` is set as the current instrument for future notes.

If you wish to use the same instrument for consecutive notes, you only need to set it once.

```js
[
  1, 1, 0,        // Set instrument 1 and play C-1
  0, 5, 0,        // Using current instrument (1), play E-1
  0, 6, 0         // Using current instrument (1), play F-1
  2, 3, 0         // Set instrument 2 and play D-1
],
```

## Channel Attenuation

If this slot contains a value between 1 and 64 the volume of the channel is reduced accordingly. A value of `1` sets the volume to 100%, `64` sets the volume to 0%.

```js
[
  1, 1, 0,        // Set instrument 1 and play C-1
  0, 0, 16,       // Drop volume by 25%
  0, 0, 32,       // Drop volume by 50%
  0, 0, 48,       // Drop volume by 75%
  2, 1, 0         // Set instrument 2 and play C-1 (Attenuation is reset)
],
```

## Sequence Structure

```
[
  <integer>,
  ...
]
```

Sequence is an array of numbers indexing `<pattern>` entries in the `<pattern-list>`. Each pattern in the sequence is played until there are no remaining values, at which point the song is complete.

```js
[0, 1, 1, 2]       // play pattern 0 followed by pattern 1 (twice) then pattern 2
```

## Speed

```
<integer>
```

The speed of the song. Lower is faster. Default speed is 6.


## Panning Structure

```
[
  <number>?,
  ...
]
```

Set the stereo positioning of each song channel. A value of `-1` will cause the channel to play from the left speaker. A value of `1` will cause the channel to play from the right speaker. A value between `-1` and `1` will move the channel between the left and right speaker, with `0` causing the channel to play from both.

If no panning arrau is set the player will alternate channels between left and right speakers, with even numbered channels playing from the left speaker and odd channels from the right. If the panning array doesn't contain enough values for the number of channels in the song, the extra channel panning will default to `0` (centre)

Some example:

* `undefined` — Alternate channels between left and right speakers.
* `[]` — Play all channels from both speakers (mono)
* `[-1,0,1]` — Play channel 0 from the left speaker, channel 1 from both (centred) and channel 2 from the right speaker

## Metadata Structure

```
{
  <song-property>,
  ...
}
```

Metadata is used to store song information that isn't required for playback such as the title, credits and human-readable aliases for data.

Property | Description
-|-
`name` | Title of the song
`author` | Name of the composer
`instruments` | Array of instrument names that map to `<instrument-list>`

```js
const mySong = [
  [
    [1, 0, 200],
    [1, 0, 500]
  ],
  [ /* ...patterns... */ ],
  [ /* ...sequence... */ ],
  6,
  {
    title: "My Song",
    author: "Keith Clark",
    instruments: ["Bass", "Piano"]
  }
]
```
